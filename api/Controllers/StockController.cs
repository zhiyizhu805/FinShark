/*
ControllerBase and IActionResult:

ControllerBase is a lightweight base class for API controllers in ASP.NET Core, providing core HTTP response methods.
IActionResult is a flexible return type that lets you return different HTTP responses (Ok(), NotFound(), etc.).
Ok() and Ok(stocks):

Ok() returns HTTP 200, indicating success.
Ok(stocks) returns HTTP 200 with stocks as the response data.
Deferred Execution with ToList():

ToList() triggers immediate execution of the query, converting data to a list, which ends deferred execution (where the query runs only when needed).
Find Method:

Find(id) is optimal for retrieving items by primary key, using caching to reduce database calls if the item was recently accessed.
NotFound():

Returns HTTP 404, indicating the item wasnâ€™t found in the database, commonly used when Find returns null.
